A Django app that helps you find your perfect restaurant using GenAI

## Your Challenge
1. Tach each review with the sentiment of the review, i.e., if it’s positive, negative, or neutral.
2. Tag each review with a theme (e.g. "Service", "Ambiance", "Location").
3. Create an enhanced short description for each restaurant (e.g. “Cocotte Shoreditch - Brunch and Cocktails with Unmatched Hospitality”).
4. Create a chatbot that gives you a recommendation of a restaurant based on your input.
5. Get creative!
