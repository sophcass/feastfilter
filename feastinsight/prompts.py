I am going to provide you with a JSON list of 10 restaurants.
Your task is to generate a richer, more descriptive name for each restaurant based on the data provided.
Follow these guidelines:
<instructions>
2. Inclusions: The name must include the type of cuisine. The name must keep some of the original branding (e.g. A, B).
3. Length: The title must be between 3 and 10 words.

Your output must be only a JSON object. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or introductory phrases.
The JSON object should use the ID as the key and the new title as the value for each restaurant.
Structure the output like this:

We got our yummy cocktails as soon as we sat down, along with a timely and most importantly delicious food service! Thank you so much for making our celebration one to remember - we'll be back!",

            "Worst bar I've been to in the UK. Owner is hostile to customers and abusive to staff. Bouncers are needlessly aggressive. Cocktails are overpriced, taste terrible & take a rediculously long time to be served. For your own good, avoid this place. It has a low rating for a reason.",
            "i came in to the bar a bit over a week ago to watch england mach, the drinks were ok but shortly realised the aperol sprits we were ordering had an insufficient amount of alcohol in them but we didn't want to complain as i could see the bartenders were under stress, we then ordered food however the cooking was extremely slow for just a mere portion of chips? the atmosphere could also be improved.",

The food all came out on a big tray which was then left for us to distribute onto smaller plates - a cool idea in theory but made the already small tables a bit cramped for space. Despite this, food was delicious and have already recommended to friends to visit.",
            "I love this place. Been coming here for years and years, generally try to get here whenever I'm in London. The burgers are very good, not quite top tier, but close. Menu has a decent selection also with a variety of things on offer. The whole vibe and aesthetic of the restaurant is superb also.",
